When writing WHERE clauses with columns containing text data, SQL supports a number of useful operators to do things like case-insensitive string comparison and wildcard pattern matching. We show a few common text-data specific operators below:

Operator	                       Condition	                                                        Example
=	                Case sensitive exact string comparison (notice the single equals)	                col_name = "abc"
!= or <>	        Case sensitive exact string inequality comparison	                                col_name != "abcd"
LIKE	            Case insensitive exact string comparison	                                        col_name LIKE "ABC"
NOT LIKE	        Case insensitive exact string inequality comparison	                                col_name NOT LIKE "ABCD"
%	                Used anywhere in a string to match a sequence of zero                               col_name LIKE "%AT%"
                    or more characters (only with LIKE or NOT LIKE)	                               (matches "AT", "ATTIC", "CAT" or even"BATS")
_	                Used anywhere in a string to match a single character                               col_name LIKE "AN_"
                     (only with LIKE or NOT LIKE)	                                                    (matches "AND", but not "AN")
IN (…)	            String exists in a list	                                                            col_name IN ("A", "B", "C")
NOT IN (…)	        String does not exist in a list	                                                    col_name NOT IN ("D", "E", "F")



Did you know?
All strings must be quoted so that the query parser can distinguish words in the string from SQL keywords.

We should note that while most database implementations are quite efficient when using these operators, full-text search is best left to dedicated libraries like Apache Lucene or Sphinx. These libraries are designed specifically to do full text search, and as a result are more efficient and can support a wider variety of search features including internationalization and advanced queries.
